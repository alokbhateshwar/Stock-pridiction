📈 Stock Price Prediction using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib
This project aims to predict and visualize stock prices using historical data. It utilizes Python libraries like Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib for plotting and visual analysis.

🧰 Technologies Used
Python 🐍

Pandas – for data preprocessing and handling CSV files

Matplotlib – for plotting trends, predictions, and insights

📂 Project Structure
Project folder contains:

data/stock_data

stock_predictor.py – Main Python script to analyze and visualize stock trends

requirements.txt – List of required Python libraries

README.md – Project documentation

📌 Features
Load and clean stock price data from CSV

Visualize trends over time (Open, Close, High, Low)

Apply simple prediction logic (e.g., moving average)

Plot predictions alongside actual value

📊 Sample Output
Line charts for Open, Close, High, and Low prices

Moving Average prediction curve

Printout summary of data info, min/max/mean prices

📚 Concepts Used
Time-series data handling using Pandas

Handling missing values and data types

Matplotlib plotting with labels and legends

Simple forecasting using moving averages or trends

✅ Future Enhancements
Add machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, LSTM)

Support real-time stock data using APIs like Yahoo Finance or Alpha Vantage
